# Chris-Networking-Architecture
This is a server to client networking architecture for Unity written by Christopher Kalitin.
On GitHub new versions will be published, smaller changes will stay privatly in Unity Teams until the next version.

I should really rename this to Simple Networking Layer (SNL). Gotta love those hilarious initialisms.
